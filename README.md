## Dataset
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mostafaabla/garbage-classification/data

## Model: ResNet50
We utilize **ResNet50**, a deep convolutional neural network that is widely recognized for its performance in image classification and feature extraction tasks. 

## Features
- **Data Augmentation**: Enhanced training with image transformations like flipping, rotation, and zooming.
- **Transfer Learning**: Leveraging pre-trained ResNet50 on ImageNet for efficient training.
- **Fine-Tuning**: Adjusting the top layers of ResNet50 for better performance.
- **Deployment-Ready**: Model export to TensorFlow.js for integration with web applications.
